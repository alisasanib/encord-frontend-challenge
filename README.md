# Encord Frontend Challenge

This is my implementation for frontend code challenge. It has been built by React + TypesScript + vite. For the UI elements and components, I used a UI library called MUI. Tests are written in Jest + React Testing Library. I added Tests for images components and also mocked its api call for `/predictions`.

# Available Scripts

To install dependencies, you can run:

```
npm ci
```

For running project locally, you can run:

```
npm run dev
```

By running this command, frontend will start the json-server mentioned in the task description.

For Running tests you can run

```
npm run test
```

For buulding the project, you can run

```
npm run build
```

# Further improvements

- Adding more tests for different component including predictions table.
- Creating more comprehensive UI.
- Replacing the json-server with proper API endpoints. For instance, We can use Next.JS API Routes.
- Making Bounding boxes more interactive for the users.
- Creating more customized UI components that could be used across the project.
